New example: cursor widget with coordinate text
-----------------------------------------------
Added a new example, which shows a widget, which is a sub class of the Cursor
widget, but displays a text field right next to the cursor showing a tuple of
the current mouse x position and the function value y at that x
coordinate or vice versa.
See :doc:`/gallery/widgets/text_cursor`.
